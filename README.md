# Syncify
An open-source "Now Playing" widget that displays what you're currently playing on SpotifyÂ®

**NOTE:** Syncify currently only works with songs and not podcasts or audiobooks. Since this is not Syncify's main purpose, the developer does not intend to add such functionality, but happily invites contributors to!

*This is an independent project that uses the Spotify API but is not affiliated with, sponsored, or endorsed by Spotify. Spotify is a registered trademark of Spotify AB.*

## Setup & Usage Guide
**Syncify requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to run and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to build. Please download both before continuing.**

### Initial Setup
**You will only have to do this once!**<br/>
**Stuck? Need a video instead? [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YG_Po0OduQ) for a full walkthrough.**
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/AntAptive/Syncify`
2. Enter the newly created folder and install all necessary packages: `cd Syncify && npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
    * **NOTE:** You will need to run this every time you make changes to your config or Syncify's code.
	* This will create your `config.env` file, which you can find in the root of the project directory.
4. Go to your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and create a new app.
	1. Click **Create App**.
	2. Set **App name** & **App description** to whatever you want.
	3. Add the **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:PORT/callback`, **PORT** being the port which you want Syncify to use on your machine. (The default port is 8888. You can change it in your `config.env` file)
	4. Agree to Spotify's Developer ToS and Design Guidelines.
	5. Click **Save**, then **Settings** at the top-right.
	6. Copy the **Client ID** and replace `your-client-id-here` in `config.env` with your client ID. Do the same with your client secret by clicking **View client secret**.
5. Populate `config.env` with your credentials and preferences, then build the project again: `npm run build`
    * The reason we're building again is to generate essential files for Syncify that rely on information in `config.env`.
	* **NOTE:** Ensure your `config.env` is configured properly or you will encounter issues.
6. Open `start.bat` to start Syncify.
7. Syncify will now say `Please visit http://localhost:PORT/login to authenticate with Spotify`. Visit the supplied link in a web browser to complete authentication with Spotify.
8. Visit `http://localhost:PORT` in a web browser or an OBS browser source to begin using Syncify.

Syncify can be closed by simply clicking the X button for its command prompt window.

### Using Syncify after setup
It's as easy as opening `start.bat`!<br/>
If your `tokens.json` file is corrupted or missing, you will have to re-authenticate with Spotify.<br/>
Syncify can be closed by simply clicking the X button for its command prompt window.

### Using Spotify in OBS Studio
**NOTE:** Syncify will only display if the server is running. Open `start.bat` in Syncify's files to start the server.
1. Create a new **Browser** source by clicking the Add (+) button at the bottom of your **Sources** dock. Call it whatever you want.
2. Set the **URL** to `localhost:PORT`, **PORT** being the port which Syncify is using on your machine (The default port is 8888. You can change it in your `config.env` file)
3. Click **OK**.

## Troubleshooting
If you're encountering issues, ensure your `config.env` file is configured properly and run `npm run build`.<br/>
If issues are persistent and you're unsure how to resolve them, contact me on Discord or open an issue.

## Configuration
All of Syncify's config is in `config.env`, which is generated after running `npm run build` for the first time.
* **CLIENT_ID** & **CLIENT_SECRET**: Your Spotify API credentials. See above in Setup & Usage Guide for how to create a Spotify app and figure out what to put here.
* **PORT**: The port on your machine that Syncify will run on. Must be a number between 1024 and 65535.
* **THEME**: What theme file (in [src/themes](/src/themes)) Syncify will serve.
* **VERBOSITY**: The level of messages sent to the console. 
	* **0**: Critical messages only
    * **1** *(Default)*: Errors
	* **2**: Important info
	* **3**: Debug | **NOTE:** A verbosity level of 3 or higher may output sensitive information to the console and is intended for developers and advanced users only. **DO NOT** use level 3 if you are a streamer.
	

## Supplied Themes

The supplied themes in the [src/themes](/src/themes) folder follow Spotify's branding guidelines and are suitable for all uses.

Please note that the example themes in the [src/themes/examples](/src/themes/examples) folder are for **EXAMPLE ONLY**. The example themes demonstrate Syncify's capabilities and are intended for:
- Learning purposes
- Private/personal use
- Reference for creating your own themes

If you plan to distribute or use these themes publicly, ensure they comply with [Spotify's Design & Branding Guidelines](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/design).


## Creating Custom Themes

Syncify uses the React framework so you can customize it to look & behave exactly how you want!

To create your own theme, create a .jsx file in [src/themes](/src/themes). You can look at the existing themes there and in the [examples](/src/themes/examples) folder for examples to help build your own theme file.

All themes must have a `Theme` const which should return the structure of the theme. It should be exported with `export default Theme` at the end of the file. See the [example themes](/src/themes/examples) for more information.

### Contributing Public Themes
If you wish to contribute a public theme to be included with Syncify, your theme must be appropriate and comply with [Spotify's Design & Branding Guidelines](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/design).
